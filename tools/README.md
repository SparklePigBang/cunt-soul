Cunt Soul Tools
===============


This is a collection of tools related to the Cunt Soul rules. Currently, the only tool available is a tool for building in a linux shell.


Building in a Linux Shell
-------------------------

To build, `cd` to the main directory and run

    sh tools/build.sh

This will generate `rules.html` and `rules.pdf` in the main directory.

Note, this script creates and then removes a directory called `tmp`, so make sure you don't store the only picture of your long-lost sweetheart in a folder named `tmp`.
